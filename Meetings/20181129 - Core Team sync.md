# Core team sync, 29.11.2018

## Present: 
* Anine
* Hodo
* Bjørn
* Alexander
* Einar
* Jakob
* Samson
* Rebecca 

## Updates:
* Moved into new UX tool (UXPIN) 
* Analytics are ready to go – now with static json data. Needs backend and frontend to be kickstarted at same time. Jacob will look into it. Issues need to be created.
* We need to document that we have a local and a global version of CBS – Alex taking this with Einar. He will then share the slide to the requirement change. 
* Documentation folder in github needs looking at.  
* Been working on notification gateway.
* Dolittle and Samson to work on multitenancy.
* Senegal update: following a first assessment it has been found that there is already a CBS system being used in Senegal (based on RapidPro). As we want to make sure that we are not duplicating efforts and that there is a real need for CBS before implementation, futher evaluation is required. For this reason, planning and implementation is slightly delayed. Red Cross will keep everyone posted, and hope to have more clarity soon! :-)  
*	Code evening next week potentially postponed due to busy schedules of Red Cross and core team. Informal gathering to be scheduled instead? Rebecca to follow up 
*	Codeathon 4.0 18th to 19th of January - Save the Date!!!
