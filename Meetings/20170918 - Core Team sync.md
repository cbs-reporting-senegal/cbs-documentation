* Summary

## Notes

Welcome to Anders, Kristian and Fredrik as new core team members! 

### Core team guidelines
1. Opting out should be just as easy as opting in
2. All technical choices and architectural choices are made with sustainability and ease of maintenance as priority one. 
3. Any decision made can (and should) be questioned, we don't always have all the answers.

### Main challenges

1. Einar's workload needs to be reduced
2. No backlog yet, RC needs guidance
3. How do we get quickly up and running during the codeathon?

### Assigned responsibilities

**Einar:** Prioritize backlog and continue what he's doing.  
**Karoline:** Cake/Fake + AppVeyor. "Getting started" for participants, intro on Friday & team organizing.  
**Anders**: APIs (sync with Einar), and help Einar in setting up sample infrastructure.  
**Kristian**: Identity server (sync with Fredrik, if needed).  
**Fredrik**: High-level explanation of domain-driven design, best-practice for use of Docker/Containers.  

### Needed, not assigned: 
* Someone needs to take ownership of storage and front-end decisions. Should we include more members into the core team or can these decisions be taken during the codeathon?
