# Product Owners

This section describe how you as a product owner can work with the backlog.
As a product owner you're responsible to verify that the backlog is accurate and in the right order
at any given time. Any items sitting in the *Backlog* column is for you as a product owner to go
through and make sure they're correct. Once they're correct you move them into the *Ready* column.
In this column people will pick from the top and implement.

For how you should be creating issues, read more in depth [here](./issues.md).
