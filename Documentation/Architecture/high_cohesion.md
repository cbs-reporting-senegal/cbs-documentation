# High cohesion

The core principle of high cohesion is to keep artifacts related to each other for a specific tier (layer) of the system together.
Instead of segregating on function, you'd segregate on system structure - for instance module and feature names.
With a consistent naming strategy throughout the system and keeping with high cohesion, the system becomes easier
to navigate - especially for new people coming in as well. Everything that is related to each other would then be together.
